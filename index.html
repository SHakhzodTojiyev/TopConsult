											Malaysia is an amazing country of unusual combinations,
											where in the capital you can find a traditional Malay
											village, squeezed by skyscrapers; where huge multi-colored
											butterflies sit on the hoods of expensive cars, and a king
											with a magnificent title signs bills proposed by
											parliament. Malaysia, which gained independence only in
											1957, is today an actively developing country, the
											industrial sector of which makes up about half of the GDP;
											in second place is the sphere of services and tourism. It
											is curious that Malaysia is the world leader in the
											production of certain types of household appliances and
											electronics. The motley ethnic composition, friendly
											coexistence of different nationalities with their own
											traditions and customs, combined with the unique nature,
											make Malaysia especially attractive for tourists from all
											over the world. Malaysia is a federal elective
											constitutional monarchy, consisting of three federal
											territories and thirteen states, nine of which are
											monarchies, whose hereditary rulers (sultans) are also the
											spiritual heads of the states. Once every five years, they
											elect the Supreme Ruler of the country - the king (his
											title in Malay sounds like "Yang di-Pertuan Agong"), who
											performs representative functions. The real government of
											the country is in the hands of the parliament and the
											cabinet of ministers. Climate The country is characterized
											by a hot and humid equatorial climate dependent on
											monsoons. During the day and throughout the year, the air
											temperature fluctuates very slightly - from 25 ° to 28 °
											C, only in lowlands, and especially river ones, can exceed
											30 ° C. Air humidity in the rainy season reaches 90% - but
											the showers are mostly short-term (no more than two
											hours). On the east coast of Malacca (West Malaysia), in
											the west of Sarawak and in the northeast of Sabah, the
											rainy season is from October-November to February; on the
											west coast (Langkawi, Penang, Pangkor islands) - in
											April-May and from October to December. There are no
											seismically active zones on the territory of the country -
											this factor and temperature stability allow tourists to
											plan a trip to Malaysia at any time of the year. Currency
											The national currency of Malaysia is the ringgit (denoted
											as MYR); banknotes in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50
											and 100 ringgit. The ringgit is divided into 100 sen -
											coins of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 sen are used. Dollars, euros,
											British pounds sterling can be exchanged at all Malaysian
											commercial banks and some hotels. Banks are open on
